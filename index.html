              <h2>About</h2>
              <p>
                The Innovation Challenge is a semester-long program hosted by CEAS Tribunal and the Lindner Center for Entrepreneurship.
                Students are given the opportunity to develop an entrepreneurial idea that they have and work on it with a team of students or by themselves.
                This involves developing a pitch deck, creating a prototype, performing market research, and presenting final product and a 5-minute pitch
                to a panel of judges.
                <br />
                <br />
                Students are eligible to receive $750 for participating in the challenge. Besides ideating and innovating, the challenge is a 
                huge social opportunity to meet and collaborate with new people, network with industry professionals, collaborate on ideas,
                and become part of a community of students looking to do cool things and help create the future.
                <br />
